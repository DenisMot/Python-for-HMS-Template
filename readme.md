# A minimal template for data analysis with python 

This is a minimal template for data analysis with python, intended to researchers in human movement sciences that are new to python.   
Cloning this template for each new data analysis problem should facilitate data analyses with python and minimize potential errors.   

## Usage (without Git)
1. Download as a zip file (green button `< > Code` on the top right of the page)
1. Expand the archive on your computer (e.g., in your `Download` folder). 
1. Rename the extracted folder with the name of your new project (e.g., `ECG_analysis`)
1. Move the new `ECG_analysis` folder where it should be located (e.g., in your `Documents/CodeProjects/` directory)
1. In VSCode :
    1. open the new project in a new window. 
    1. open `main.ipynb` and click `Run all`

## Requirements
- VSCode with the python and jupyter extensions installed (or any other IDE that supports python and jupyter notebooks)
